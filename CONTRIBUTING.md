# Contributing

## Take Your First Steps

- Try going through the project requirements and the code. See wiki and milestones etc.
- Run it in your local.
- Join the [discord](https://gitter.im/openMF/digital-bank-ui) for this project.
- Try understanding the project code, we are using rxjs and ngrx store, which might be a new thing for you.
- Go through the code and start finding bugs, there are tons of bugs currently. Make issues for those bugs and raise pr, like smaller css issues, or code refactoring. We need a lot of refactoring, go through angular best practices and see what code can be refactored.
- Then maybe work on some functionality issues.
- You don't have to make a lot of pr's, just focus on quality of pr's.

This project will require a few days for getting used to, and understanding what's happening.
Also, you don't have to run fineract CN in your local, we are using a hosted instance of fineract CN, which has a few microservices hosted at buffalo.mifos URL. Check out https://github.com/openMF/digital-bank-ui/blob/master/proxy.conf.json

Also take time to learn about rxjs, ngrx store and redux store in general, and also what we are trying to do in this project. Play around with the UI a bit on your machine.

### Understand the basics

Not sure what a pull request is, or how to submit one? Take a look at GitHub's excellent [help
documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) first.

### Search Issues or; create an issue if necessary

### Discuss non-trivial contribution ideas with committers

## Create a Branch

### Branch from `master`

Master currently represents current work progress. Please submit all pull requests there, even bug fixes and minor improvements. We might have a `develop` branch going forward for new pr's.

Also this project is in nascent stages, you can make the issue templates, pr templates, readme etc better, other similar things.
